# cs41-python

This repository is a set of exercises and assignments included in the CS41 intro to Python programming course.

I did not take this course while at Stanford, but I watched the lectures and completed most of the exercises/assignments independently. It was an excellent course overall and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to improve their core competency with Python.
